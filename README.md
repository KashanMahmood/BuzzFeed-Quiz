This is a buzzfeed-like quiz that I created using javascript, CSS, and HTML. 
The above link shows you how it works.
If you look at the code itself, I have generalized it enough so that if the correct formal is followed, you are able to create this quiz using your own inputs.
IT IS IMPERTIVE THAT YOU FOLLOW THE FOMAT OF THE JSON FILE PROVIDED OR IT WILL NOT WORK
