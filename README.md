## What Worked Well
After the javascript part it was quite simple to make the site look pretty. I think the layout worked well and i like how it turend out

## What Didn't
JQuery gave me some problems with its syntax. Also having hard coded the html and then using the JSON mehtod made things a little complicated - especially since i would have to inspect every time i wanted to see my code. Also, the assignment wanted me to add pictures to every question's header but i didn't like how it looked so i used solid background-colors instead. I my javascript and jSon file I took this into account and made sure if i wanted to add an image to qeustions, all i would have to do is put the url in the JSON file - this was to show that I am able to do it and am not just refusing to add the pictures because i dont knwo how to. 

## Extra Credit
    why might it be better for this to be placed at the bottom rather than in <head> ... </head>?
        Because it can improve page load - since script compliation can slow down the display. 
        
    I added box-shadows, had almost no html (generalized the javascript enough to work with almost any quiz given in the specified template)
    I added the box shadow insert filter to make the questions and answer options look pretier
